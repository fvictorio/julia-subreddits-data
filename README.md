A simple Julia script to play with [a dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/8hy0lf/subreddit_traffic_52_subs_sampled_every_10/) of subreddits traffic.

The script generates a CSV which shows, for each subreddit, the number of subscribers, the average percentage of connected users, and the position of each subreddit when sorted by those two values.
